96,1,immutable,high,very focused on my work but more attentive to the positive state of mind of Y,7,"The participant mentions being 'very focused on my work', suggesting a strong concern for their work responsibilities, which would include not being late and upsetting their boss. This indicates a high priority on their professional policy.",8,"The phrase 'more attentive to the positive state of mind of Y' indicates that the participant was significantly influenced by Y's mood/trust level. The comparative 'more' suggests that while work was important, Y's positive state took precedence in their decision-making, showing high concern for the other person's trust.",0,"There is no explicit mention of considering Y's certainty about their trust. The participant only references the 'positive state of mind of Y' (which relates to trust/mood) but does not mention anything about how certain Y was about this trust. Without any indication they considered certainty, this receives the lowest rating."
83,1,certain,high,"If V was already slightly happy, I could afford to get to work on time",7,"The participant's decision to 'get to work on time' indicates a relatively high concern for not being late to work and avoiding upsetting their boss. They prioritize work punctuality when the other person (V) is 'already slightly happy,' suggesting that their work responsibility takes precedence when they feel the other person's needs are somewhat satisfied.",5,"The participant shows moderate consideration for V's mood by noting they are 'already slightly happy.' The phrasing 'I could afford to get to work on time' implies that they are weighing V's emotional state against their work obligations, suggesting they do care about V's trust/mood but it's not their highest priority in this scenario.",0,There is no explicit mention or reference to V's certainty about their trust in the participant's response. The participant only references V's mood state ('slightly happy') but doesn't address whether V was certain or uncertain about their feelings. The certainty dimension doesn't appear to factor into their decision-making process based on this response.
48,0,certain,high,"V is happy, let's get to work on time",9,"The participant expresses a clear priority of getting to work on time, indicating they highly value following work policy and not upsetting their boss. Their decision focuses primarily on the workplace commitment rather than helping the other person.",3,"The participant acknowledges V's happy mood (which likely indicates trust), but doesn't seem to weigh this heavily in their decision. They note V is happy but still prioritize work, suggesting only minimal consideration of V's trust/mood in their decision-making process.",0,"There is no evidence in the response that the participant considered the certainty of V's trust at all. They mention V's mood (happiness) but make no reference to how certain V was about their trust, which would have been indicated by the character color in the study."

Their response solely focuses on the other person's emotional state.,10,"The participant explicitly stated that their motivation was to 'keep them happy', indicating they were entirely focused on the other person's mood/trust. This suggests they made their decision primarily based on maintaining the other person's positive emotional state.",0,There is no indication that the participant considered the certainty of the other person's trust.

32,1,certain,high,"He was already happy, so changing that would have been harder, so I could focus on work more. ",7,The participant indicates that they could 'focus on work more' which suggests a relatively high concern for work obligations and potentially upsetting their boss. They seem to prioritize work because the other person was already happy.,5,"The participant acknowledges the other person's mood ('already happy'), showing moderate consideration of trust. They recognize the current positive state but don't indicate strong motivation to maintain or enhance it, suggesting they value it but not above work priorities.",2,"There is minimal evidence that the participant considered the certainty of the other person. The statement 'changing that would have been harder' might indirectly relate to certainty (implying a stable happy state), but there's no explicit mention of considering how certain the other person was about their trust or mood."
9,0,immutable,high,"I felt like Y has a reserve of happiness in this state and so on balance it is better to focus on being on time for work, like there was a certain tolerance or allowance that I was given.",7,"The participant explicitly mentions focusing on 'being on time for work,' suggesting this was a priority in their decision making. Their wording indicates they weighed the options and decided that their work obligation was more important in this scenario.",5,"The participant acknowledges Y's mood/trust ('reserve of happiness') and considers it in their decision, but ultimately decides it can be deprioritized. They recognize Y's emotional state but don't seem deeply concerned about affecting it negatively, believing Y has an 'allowance' or 'tolerance' that permits the participant to prioritize work.",3,"The participant mentions Y's 'state' but doesn't explicitly refer to certainty. The reference to 'reserve' and 'tolerance' could implicitly suggest some awareness of Y's certainty level, but this consideration isn't clearly articulated or emphasized as a primary factor in their decision-making process."
81,1,immutable,high,"I knew that Y's mood would stay positive either way, so I tried to balance pleasing Y and my boss",5,"The participant explicitly mentions trying to 'balance pleasing Y and my boss,' indicating they were moderately concerned about their boss. They don't express extreme worry about being late or upsetting their boss, but they do factor it into their decision-making process as part of a balancing act.",5,"The participant says they tried to 'balance pleasing Y and my boss,' suggesting they cared about Y's mood/trust to a moderate degree. They note Y's mood would 'stay positive either way,' which indicates they were considering Y's feelings, but perhaps didn't feel an urgent need to prioritize them since Y would be positive regardless.",7,"The phrase 'I knew that Y's mood would stay positive either way' suggests the participant was quite confident about Y's reaction. Their language indicates certainty ('I knew') about the outcome, suggesting they took Y's certainty into consideration when making their decision."
0,0,immutable,high,"I tended to focus on pleasing my friends until the end of the week, seeing as my boss had such poor memory",3,"The participant seems to have some consideration for their boss, but it's relatively low. They mention the 'poor memory' of their boss, which suggests they are less concerned about the consequences of being late to work as they believe the boss won't remember it well. They explicitly state they prioritized 'pleasing friends' over workplace responsibilities, at least until the end of the week.",8,"The participant puts a high emphasis on 'pleasing friends', indicating they cared significantly about the other person's mood/trust. The fact that they prioritized this over potential workplace consequences suggests trust was a primary consideration in their decision-making process.",0,"There is no explicit mention of considering the certainty of the other person in their decision. The response focuses on their prioritization (friends over boss) and the boss's memory, but doesn't reference anything about how certain the other person was about trusting them or how this affected their decision."
56,1,immutable,high,"when G was in a relatively happy state of mind, I tried to focus on work, since their happy state created a tolerance buffer, so they wouldn't be as angry as quick",8,"The participant clearly prioritizes work, stating they 'tried to focus on work.' This suggests a strong concern about potential professional consequences and being late, indicating they highly value adhering to work policies.",6,"The participant acknowledges and considers G's emotional state ('happy state of mind'), showing moderate concern for the other person's mood. They specifically note this happy state creates a 'tolerance buffer,' indicating they're taking G's trust/mood into account in their decision-making.",2,"There is little evidence the participant is considering certainty in their decision. They mention G's happy state creating a tolerance buffer, but don't reference how certain G is about their trust or mood. The response focuses on G's emotional state rather than G's certainty about that state."
48,0,immutable,high,Tried to keep him happy,0,"There is no mention or indication of caring about being late to work or any concern about the boss's reaction.

This shows a high level of concern for the other person's emotional state, though not explicitly stating the maximum possible concern.",0,There is no reference to considering the certainty of the other person in the decision-making process. The response only mentions trying to keep the other person happy but doesn't acknowledge anything about how certain the other person was about their trust level.
25,1,immutable,high,they seemed volatile so i wanted to please them,0,The participant does not mention their boss or being late to work at all. Their response solely focuses on the other person's emotional state (perceived volatility) and their desire to please this person.,8,"The participant shows high concern for the other person's mood by describing them as 'volatile' and expressing a clear desire to 'please them'. This indicates they were strongly motivated by the other person's emotional state/trust, though they don't explicitly mention trust itself.",3,"While the participant mentions volatility which might imply some awareness of the other person's certainty level (volatile could suggest uncertainty), they don't explicitly mention certainty. The response doesn't clearly indicate they were considering how certain/uncertain the other person was in their trust judgment."
55,1,immutable,high,"If someone was trusting of me, I felt more pressure to be honest and do good, and I wanted them to know that I delivered it, but at the same time, I felt I have to minimise the effect on my job. I felt more obliged to deliver the parcel at the beginning of the week on Monday - and then anymore deliveries after this I deemed ""unfair"" and tried to prioritise my work.",7,"The participant explicitly mentions trying to 'minimise the effect on my job' and prioritizing work over deliveries after Monday, suggesting they placed significant importance on not upsetting their boss by being late to work. The statement about finding multiple deliveries 'unfair' indicates a clear boundary where work obligations take precedence.",8,"The participant states that when someone trusted them, they 'felt more pressure to be honest and do good,' suggesting they were highly influenced by the other person's trust. They wanted the person to know they delivered the item, indicating they cared substantially about maintaining the trust relationship.",3,"There is no explicit mention of considering the other person's certainty in their trust. While the participant discusses responding to trust, they don't specifically reference whether they took into account how certain the other person was about their trust. The absence of this consideration suggests that certainty played a minimal role in their decision-making process."

Attempted to balance.",5,"The participant explicitly mentions trying to 'balance' between making V unhappy and making their boss happy, indicating they gave some consideration to their boss's feelings about them being late. They acknowledge that not delivering would make the boss happy, suggesting moderate concern for work policy/boss's expectations.",7,"The participant notes that V was happy and that not delivering would make V unhappy, showing significant concern for V's mood/trust.

93,1,certain,high,G had medium responsiveness and I could afford to disappoint him a little.,7,"The response indicates a moderate to high concern about disappointing the boss. The participant mentions they 'could afford to disappoint him a little,' suggesting that disappointing the boss is a significant concern, but one they were willing to compromise on slightly in this situation. This implies the boss's reaction was a primary consideration in their decision-making process.",5,"The participant mentions 'medium responsiveness,' which appears to refer to the trust level of the other person. This suggests they were moderately concerned about the other person's trust or mood, acknowledging it but not giving it the highest priority. The fact that they noted this characteristic suggests they did take it into account in their decision.",0,There is no explicit mention of the certainty of the other person (represented by character color) in their response. The participant only refers to the 'medium responsiveness' (likely referring to trust/mood) but doesn't address whether the other person was certain or uncertain about this trust.

The response focuses entirely on the other person's reactions.,8,"The participant appears highly concerned with the other person's mood/trust, noting how they remained 'very happy' when the participant did 'exactly as [they] wanted' but became 'upset' with even a 'slight deviation'. This indicates the participant was closely monitoring and responding to the other's happiness level (trust), suggesting high importance placed on maintaining the other's positive mood.",2,"There is minimal indication that the participant considered the certainty of the other person. The response focuses on the reaction pattern of the other person (happy when obeyed, upset with deviations) but doesn't explicitly mention considering how certain the other person was about their trust. The observation that the other person would 'tend to stay' upset might very indirectly relate to certainty in predicting the other's emotional state, but this is a stretch."

There is no mention of work considerations or the boss's reaction in their explanation of their decision-making process. Their focus is entirely on exploiting V's trust rather than workplace consequences.,9,"The participant explicitly acknowledges considering V's trust level (stating they 'exploited V's trust'). Trust was clearly the central factor in their decision-making, though they used this understanding manipulatively rather than cooperatively. They recognized that V trusted them and strategically used this knowledge to their advantage.",8,"The participant references V giving them 'benefit of the doubt', indicating they considered V's uncertainty about their actions. This suggests they understood that V wasn't completely certain but was inclined to trust them, and they deliberately exploited this uncertainty. This shows high awareness of the certainty dimension in their decision-making."

There is no evidence that the participant considered this aspect at all in their decision-making process.,9,"The participant explicitly mentions that they 'appreciated that they had a good feeling about me' and wanted to 'prove them right,' indicating they were strongly motivated by the other person's trust (good feeling) and wanted to validate this trust.

This suggests a moderate to high concern for their job and boss, but not absolute prioritization.",7,"The participant bases their decision on G being 'still sorta happy', indicating they're significantly considering G's mood/trust in their decision. They're making choices based on preserving G's positive mood, showing substantial concern for the trust relationship.",2,"The participant mentions taking 'a path that they couldn't see', which might indirectly reference managing G's perception, but doesn't explicitly mention considering G's certainty about their decision.

The participant's response is very brief and only mentions emotion not changing, without any reference to work consequences.",2,"The participant seems to be somewhat considering the other person's emotion by noting it 'would not change,' suggesting minimal acknowledgment of the other person's mood/trust. However, the extremely brief response provides very little evidence that this was a major factor in their decision-making process.",0,There is no indication that the participant considered the certainty of the other person in their decision. The response makes no reference to the character's color or any concept related to certainty/uncertainty.
65,1,immutable,high,G's state of mind didn't seem to change as much negatively as the others unless their was a consistent pattern. ,0,"There is no mention or consideration of the boss, work, or being late in the response. The participant's response focuses solely on G's state of mind, without any reference to how their decision would affect their work situation.",8,"The participant seems highly focused on G's state of mind, specifically noting how G's negative reaction compared to others. The response suggests they were carefully observing and comparing emotional reactions, indicating they cared significantly about G's trust/mood and how their actions affected it.",7,"The participant explicitly mentions looking for a 'consistent pattern' in G's reactions, suggesting they were paying attention to the certainty aspect.

12,0,certain,high,"Because Y was already pretty happy, I thought that it was a good time to please my boss.",8,"The participant explicitly states that they chose to 'please [their] boss', indicating that the boss's satisfaction was a primary motivation in their decision. The high value reflects that pleasing the boss appears to be the main driver of their choice.",5,"The participant acknowledges Y's mood ('already pretty happy'), showing some consideration of the other person's emotional state.

The balanced approach (50/50 split of attention) suggests they assigned equal importance to their job responsibilities and other considerations.",5,"The participant mentions trying to 'please them half of the time', indicating they gave moderate consideration to the other person's mood/trust. This shows they cared enough about the other person's feelings to factor it into their decision-making, but not enough to prioritize it above all else.",2,"There is minimal evidence that the participant considered the certainty of the other person. They mention making decisions based on their own 'vibe' and balancing between pleasing the other person and the boss, but don't explicitly mention factoring in how certain the other person was about their trust. The casual 'lol' and reference to their own 'vibe' suggests more spontaneous rather than analytical decision-making."

They mention doing it 'few times a week,' indicating they're not willing to always be late to work, suggesting they do care about their job commitments.",7,"The participant shows considerable attention to G's mood/trust, mentioning their perception that G is 'usually happy or does not get angry much' and seems 'understandable.' This perception of G's temperament significantly influences their decision-making process.",3,"There is minimal explicit consideration of certainty. While the participant mentions their perception of G's temperament ('usually happy'), they don't clearly reference any indicators of G's certainty about trust.

This suggests a high concern for their work policy.",3,"While the participant acknowledges Y's 'state of mind' (which likely refers to Y's mood/trust level), they ultimately decided that it was less important than pleasing the boss. This indicates some awareness of Y's trust but relatively low prioritization of it.",1,There is no explicit mention of Y's certainty about their trust in the participant's response.

They use this trust as justification for their chosen course of action, showing they value maintaining this trust.",1,"There is no explicit mention of the other person's certainty in their trust.

The low-moderate rating reflects this implicit concern that seems to be creating their internal conflict.",7,"The statement 'usually if G trusted me, I'd try to help them' strongly indicates that the participant's decision-making is heavily influenced by whether the other person trusts them. The participant seems to view the other's trust as a significant factor that would normally motivate them to help despite potential costs to themselves.",0,There is no mention or indication that the participant considered the certainty of the other person's trust in their decision-making process.

While they don't explicitly mention their boss or work policy, the phrasing suggests work obligations took precedence over further improving G's already positive mood.",4,"The participant acknowledges G's positive mood/trust ('already happy with me') but explicitly states they 'didn't worry as much about making G happier.' This indicates moderate consideration of G's trust/happiness, but not enough to strongly influence their decision when G was already in a positive state.",0,There is no mention or indication that the participant considered G's certainty about their trust. The response only references G's mood/happiness state without any consideration of how certain G was about that state.

The participant's statement is very brief and only mentions going along with 'his thinking', without any reference to work concerns.",5,"When the participant says 'I would go along with his thinking', this suggests they're considering the other person's perspective or expectations, which could relate to trust.

However, they don't explicitly mention concerns about being late or their boss's reaction, suggesting this was a secondary consideration in their decision-making process.",7,"The participant chose to deliver the item despite the potential for being late, indicating they prioritized fulfilling the request over punctuality. The simple statement 'go the short route which delivers' suggests they were primarily motivated by the desire to deliver the item, likely in response to the other person's trust expressed through their facial expression/mood.",0,"There is no indication in the participant's response that they considered the certainty level of the other person (represented by character color) in their decision-making process. They simply state they would take the route that delivers, without referring to how certain the other person was about their trust or expectations."
80,0,uncertain,high,i wanted to keep them happy,0,There is no mention or indication of concern about being late to work or upsetting their boss. The response is solely focused on the other person's emotional state.,10,The response 'i wanted to keep them happy' directly indicates that the participant's primary (and seemingly only) motivation was maintaining the other person's positive emotional state. This suggests they were highly concerned with the other person's trust/mood.,0,"There is no mention or indication that the participant considered the certainty of the other person's trust. The brief response only mentions wanting to keep the other person happy, with no reference to how certain the other person was about their trust."
11,1,immutable,high,V was happy so I thought I'd make my boss happy.,7,"The participant explicitly states that they wanted to 'make my boss happy', indicating that the boss's feelings were a significant factor in their decision-making process. This suggests they cared about not being late and maintaining a good relationship with their boss.",4,"The participant notices that 'V was happy', showing some attention to the other person's mood/trust. However, this seems to be more of an observation that influenced their decision to please their boss rather than a primary concern for V's feelings. They don't explicitly express concern for maintaining V's trust or happiness.",0,There is no mention or indication that the participant considered the certainty of the other person (represented by character color) in their decision-making process.

There is no reference to their job, time constraints, or potential negative consequences from their employer.",8,"The participant shows strong concern for the other person's mood/trust by saying 'I never wanted Y to see that I wasn't delivering,' indicating they highly valued maintaining the other person's trust. They also noted that Y 'seemed more sensitive,' suggesting they were carefully considering the emotional impact their actions would have on Y. This demonstrates significant emphasis on the other person's feelings and trust level.",2,"There is minimal evidence that the participant considered the certainty of the other person. While they mention Y 'seemed more sensitive,' this refers to Y's emotional state rather than Y's certainty about their trust. The participant doesn't explicitly reference the character color or discuss how certain/uncertain Y was about trusting them, so there's little indication they incorporated certainty into their decision-making process."
55,1,certain,high,If someone was happy with me I didn't want to disappoint them and so I tend to deliver the parcel.,0,"The participant doesn't mention any concern about being late to work or upsetting their boss. Their decision seems entirely based on the other person's mood, with no indication they considered the professional consequences.",9,"The participant explicitly states that they didn't want to disappoint someone who was 'happy with me' (showing trust), and this was their primary motivation for delivering the parcel. Their decision was directly tied to the other person's positive mood/trust.",0,"There is no indication that the participant considered the certainty of the other person's trust in their decision making. They only mention responding to the mood/happiness of the other person, but don't reference anything about how certain the other person was about their trust."

The response is entirely focused on helping V if V trusts them.,10,"The response explicitly conditions their action on V's trust ('If V trusts me, I'd like to help them'). This indicates that trust is the primary, if not only, factor in their decision making, suggesting maximum importance placed on the other person's trust.",0,There is no mention or indication that the participant considered V's certainty about their trust. The response only mentions trust as a binary condition without any reference to degrees of certainty.
89,0,immutable,high,"I tried to placate Y, risking being late at work because my boss would not remember, but not too late for the meeting.",4,"The participant acknowledges the risk of being late to work, suggesting some concern about job responsibilities, but they rationalize this by stating their boss wouldn't remember. This shows moderate consideration for work obligations, though it's not their highest priority.",8,"The primary motivation expressed is to 'placate Y', suggesting a high concern for the other person's mood or trust. The participant prioritizes this relationship over their punctuality at work, indicating they highly value maintaining or building trust with the other person.",0,"There is no explicit mention of considering the certainty of the other person in the decision-making process.

79,0,certain,high,"If the customer already has a good opinion of me, then I'm more focussed on pleasing the boss I guess.",8,The participant explicitly states they are 'more focussed on pleasing the boss' when the customer already has a good opinion of them. This indicates a high priority placed on work responsibilities and avoiding upsetting the boss.,5,"The participant acknowledges the customer's opinion ('good opinion of me'), showing they're aware of and consider the trust dimension. However, they indicate that when trust is already established, they prioritize the boss instead, suggesting moderate consideration of trust that shifts based on circumstances.",2,"There is minimal evidence that the participant considered the certainty of the other person's trust.

75,0,immutable,high,I would choose path C so they wouldn't know if I delivered it.,3,"The participant's response does not explicitly mention concern about being late for work or upsetting their boss. They choose path C to avoid the other person knowing whether they delivered the item, suggesting that work considerations are not their primary focus, though they may be implicitly considered since they're avoiding a clear commitment to delivering the item (which would make them late). I've assigned a low-moderate rating as job consequences appear to be a secondary concern at most.",5,"The participant's choice to take path C explicitly aims to keep the other person uncertain about whether the item was delivered. This suggests they are moderately concerned about the other person's trust or mood, as they're not outright refusing the favor (which would indicate low concern for trust), but they're also not committing to fulfill the request (which would indicate high concern). They are navigating a middle path that avoids confronting the trust issue directly.",8,"The participant's response clearly shows they are highly considering the certainty aspect, as their entire strategy revolves around choosing a path that would leave the other person uncertain about whether the item was delivered. The statement 'so they wouldn't know if I delivered it' directly addresses the certainty component and indicates that manipulating the other person's certainty is the primary motivation for their decision."
43,0,immutable,high,Already pleased,3,"The participant's response is very brief, only stating 'Already pleased,' which suggests minimal consideration of the work policy or the boss's feelings. There is no explicit mention of work, being late, or balancing professional responsibilities. The low score reflects this apparent lack of priority for the work context.",7,"The phrase 'Already pleased' indicates that the participant is focused on the other person's positive emotional state (trust). They appear to be making their decision primarily based on the fact that the other person was already in a good mood, suggesting they valued maintaining that trust/mood significantly.",0,There is no indication in this brief response that the participant considered the certainty of the other person's trust. The response only mentions the pleased state (mood/trust) without any reference to how certain the other person was about their trust level.
52,1,uncertain,high,"I knew I could choose a quicker path to work with a certain, but not drastic impact on Vs mood.",7,The participant's mention of a 'quicker path to work' suggests they are quite concerned about getting to work on time and not upsetting their boss. They are weighing this option seriously against the impact on V's mood.,5,"The participant acknowledges the impact on V's mood, indicating some level of care about V's trust. However, they describe this impact as 'not drastic,' suggesting moderate rather than high concern about V's mood/trust.",2,"There is no explicit reference to V's certainty about their trust. The participant mentions a 'certain' impact on V's mood, but this refers to the definite nature of the impact, not V's certainty level about their trust. The lack of consideration of V's certainty suggests minimal influence on the decision-making process."
51,1,certain,high,"G is happy, will decrease slightly but balance with boss",7,"The participant explicitly mentions the need to 'balance with boss,' indicating they are significantly concerned about their boss's reaction to being late. They recognize that helping G will cause them to be late, and this work obligation is clearly a major factor in their decision-making process.",6,The participant notes that 'G is happy' and considers that their action will 'decrease slightly' G's happiness. This shows they are quite attentive to G's mood/trust level and are weighing how their actions will affect G. They care enough about maintaining G's trust to consider the balance between helping G and being on time for work.,0,"There is no explicit mention of G's certainty or uncertainty about trusting the participant. The response does not indicate that the participant is considering whether G is certain or uncertain in their trust, focusing instead on the current happiness level and the potential slight decrease."

Their reasoning is entirely focused on the trust element of the task with no consideration of work policy.",8,"The participant explicitly mentions trust as the central factor in their decision-making. They based their action on the fact that 'he could trust me,' indicating high consideration of the trust element. The response suggests they felt no need to prove delivery because of this established trust.",2,"There is minimal indication that the participant considered the certainty of the other person's trust. While they mention trust exists, they don't explicitly reference how certain/uncertain the other person was about this trust. The statement 'it was not necessary to prove' might indirectly suggest they perceived high certainty in the other's trust, but this is not clearly articulated as a decisional factor."
37,1,immutable,high,Y's mood wouldn't change regardless of my actions.,0,The participant's response doesn't mention any consideration of being late to work or their boss's reaction. There's no indication they factored workplace consequences into their decision.,0,"The participant explicitly states that Y's mood (which represents trust) wouldn't change regardless of their actions. This indicates they believe the other person's trust level is fixed and unaffected by their choice, showing no concern for the trust dimension.",0,The response makes no reference to the certainty of the other person (represented by character color). The participant only mentions the unchanging nature of Y's mood but doesn't address whether Y was certain or uncertain about their trust level.

Their answer solely focuses on the other character G and their uncertainty state.",5,"The participant says they're 'okay with G being unsure,' which suggests some consideration of G's state, but doesn't explicitly mention G's trust or mood. They acknowledge G's state but don't elaborate on how important G's trust is to them. This indicates a moderate level of concern.",8,"The participant directly references G being 'unsure,' showing clear attention to G's certainty state. Their entire response is focused on being 'okay' with G's uncertainty, suggesting they've given significant consideration to the certainty dimension in their decision-making process."
20,1,uncertain,high,Work is my priority but as I was only in the office once this week I felt it worth delivering,8,"The participant explicitly states that 'Work is my priority', indicating a high concern for their job and, by extension, not upsetting their boss. However, they still chose to deliver the item despite this priority, which suggests their concern for work, while high, wasn't absolute.",6,"The participant decided to deliver the item despite work being their priority, suggesting they cared about the other person's trust/mood. However, they don't explicitly mention the other person's mood or trust level in their decision-making, but rather justify their decision based on their own work circumstances ('only in the office once this week').",2,The participant makes no explicit reference to the certainty of the other person's trust. Their decision appears to be based on their own work situation ('only in the office once this week') rather than any consideration of how certain the other person was about trusting them. There's no indication they factored certainty into their decision-making process.
10,1,uncertain,high,I'd take path C because Y trusts me to deliver the package,0,"The participant doesn't mention any consideration about being late to work or their boss's reaction. Their explanation is solely focused on Y's trust, with no indication that they're weighing this against potential negative consequences at work.",10,"The participant explicitly states that their decision is based on Y trusting them to deliver the package.

There is no mention of work consequences or the boss in their response, only a focus on the potential to disappoint the other person. The low value is assigned because job considerations appear to be a non-factor in their decision-making process.",6,"The participant mentions that they 'could disappoint them frequently,' indicating moderate consideration of the other person's trust or mood. While they acknowledge the potential to disappoint the character, they frame it in a way that suggests they might choose to do so due to the character being 'least responsive,' showing they care about the other's trust but not to the highest degree.",7,"The participant specifically mentions 'Yellow' as being 'least responsive,' showing they paid attention to the color coding that represented certainty. The framing suggests they're making decisions partly based on the certainty characteristic (represented by color), indicating they integrated this information into their decision-making process in a significant way."
67,1,certain,high,I had some leeway to go straight to work,3,"The participant indicates they had 'some leeway' to be late to work, suggesting they did consider their boss/work obligations but didn't see it as a major constraint. The relatively low concern about work implications is evident in their brief, matter-of-fact statement without expressing significant worry about potential consequences of being late.",0,There is no mention or consideration of the other person's mood or trust level in the response. The participant doesn't reference the facial expression of the character or indicate that the other person's feelings factored into their decision-making process.,0,"The response shows no indication that the participant considered the certainty of the other person (represented by character color).

This indicates a moderate level of concern about being late to work and upsetting their boss, as they're trying to find a balance rather than always prioritizing one option.",5,"The participant notes that 'G didnt tend to have that extreme of a reaction', which suggests they are paying attention to G's mood/trust level, but not seeing it as extremely important. The fact that they are taking a 'mix of paths' rather than always prioritizing G's mood suggests a moderate level of consideration for trust.",1,There is no explicit mention of considering G's certainty in the decision-making process. The participant only refers to G's reactions (mood/trust) but doesn't mention anything about how certain G was about this trust. The 'mix of paths' approach seems based on the moderate reactions rather than any consideration of certainty.

87,1,certain,high,As they were already in a good mood I felt they could take the dissapointment.,6,"The participant seems to be considering the consequence of their action (likely choosing not to deliver the item and thus not being late to work), as they weigh that the other person could 'take the disappointment.' This implies they are prioritizing not being late to work over helping the other person, suggesting moderate concern for work policy.",7,"The participant explicitly mentions the other person's mood state ('already in a good mood'), showing they are actively considering the trust/mood of the other person in their decision-making process. They're using the person's existing positive mood as a justification for potentially disappointing them.",0,There is no explicit mention or consideration of the certainty level of the other person.

They recognized that V was 'more lenient', suggesting moderate consideration of V's trust/mood, but ultimately used this information to justify focusing on work instead.",3,"The participant states 'I knew V would be in a positive mood', which suggests some consideration of certainty (they felt confident about V's mood). However, there is no explicit reference to how certain V was about their trust, or any consideration of V's certainty level in the decision-making process.

5,0,immutable,high,Willing to miss a delivery because they would forgive me.,3,"The participant seems somewhat concerned about missing a delivery (which is part of their job responsibility), but they are willing to do so because they believe they would be forgiven. This suggests they have some consideration for work obligations but are willing to prioritize other factors over being on time for the delivery.",8,"The participant's decision is strongly based on their belief that the other person 'would forgive me,' indicating they are very concerned with the other person's trust level. They are making their decision primarily based on their perception of the other person's reaction (forgiveness), suggesting high attention to the trust dimension.",2,"There is little explicit evidence that the participant is considering the certainty of the other person's trust.

They wanted to validate the trust the other person had in them, which suggests they highly valued maintaining that trust.",3,"There is some implicit acknowledgment of the other's mental state in wanting them to 'be right,' which could suggest the participant was responding to the other's level of certainty. However, the response doesn't explicitly mention considering how certain/uncertain the other person was in their decision making, so the rating is relatively low."

They explicitly state their strategy was 'to keep G happy' and maintain G's trustworthiness, even at the cost of consistently being late to work.",8,"The participant clearly considers G's uncertainty ('G did not know weather i went') as a key factor in their decision-making. They understood that taking route B would leave G uncertain, which would decrease G's trust, so they consistently chose option A to avoid this uncertainty.

Their response is solely focused on the observation about V's consistent mood, without any reference to workplace concerns or policy adherence.",3,"The participant mentions V's mood, indicating some awareness of and attention to V's emotional state. However, the statement is merely observational ('was usually in the same mood all week') without expressing how this affected their decision or whether they cared about V's trust.

They appear hesitant to significantly inconvenience themselves, which indicates concern about potential consequences at work.",5,"The participant acknowledges the other person's mood ('they were already happy'), indicating moderate consideration of the other person's trust. They factor this into their decision-making, noting they didn't feel obligated to 'go completely out of my way' because the person already appeared happy/trusting. This suggests they consider the other's mood but don't place extremely high importance on it.",2,There is minimal evidence that the participant considered the certainty of the other person's trust. They only mention the person being 'already happy' but don't reference anything about how certain the other person was in their trust or mood.

The focus on pleasing the other person suggests high consideration of their mood/trust.,3,"There's no explicit reference to the certainty of the other person. The statement 'only had one day to please them' doesn't directly address whether they considered how certain the other person was about trusting them. The time limitation might indirectly relate to certainty considerations, but this connection is tenuous."

Their statement implies they prioritized their boss over the other person (V), suggesting minimal consideration of V's trust/mood in their decision-making process.",4,"The participant mentions that 'V wouldn't know if I missed the delivery', which suggests some consideration of V's certainty or knowledge state. They're taking into account that V would be unaware of their action (missing the delivery), which shows they're factoring in V's certainty to some degree, but not as a primary factor in their decision."
31,1,uncertain,high,G is happy so I tried to be on time to work.,8,"The participant's main focus appears to be on being on time to work, indicating they prioritize their work responsibilities and avoiding upsetting their boss.

They only express that they were 'rooting for the characters,' which doesn't indicate any concern about work policy.",6,"By stating they were 'rooting for the characters,' the participant seems to have developed some emotional investment in the scenario and likely the trust relationship between characters. This suggests they cared about the interpersonal dynamics, though the statement is quite vague. The comment about 'Same as Y' indicates they maintained a consistent approach to a previous scenario, but without knowing what Y was, it's difficult to assess precisely how much trust factored in.",0,There is no indication in the response that the participant considered the certainty of the other person in their decision-making process. The brief statement doesn't reference the character's color or any consideration of how certain the other character was about their trust.

There's no indication that the participant factored workplace consequences into their decision.",8,"The statement 'He was much more challenging to please' strongly suggests the participant was focused on the other person's mood/trust. The wording indicates they were trying to please the other person and found it difficult, implying they cared significantly about the other's trust or approval.",2,"There is minimal evidence that the participant considered the certainty aspect. While the statement might indirectly suggest they noticed variations in the other person's reactions (which could relate to certainty), there's no explicit mention of considering how certain/uncertain the other person was about their trust.

This suggests a high concern for the potential consequences of being late.",3,"The reference to 'V changes quickly' suggests they noticed the other person's mood/trust level and acknowledged it was variable, but this doesn't appear to be their primary concern. They recognize the trust/mood aspect but prioritize their boss over this consideration.",2,"There's minimal indication that the participant is taking into account the certainty aspect. The mention of 'V changes quickly' might indirectly reference uncertainty, but there's no explicit consideration of how certain the other person was about their trust. Their focus remains on their boss despite any changes in the other person."
38,1,uncertain,high,When while was pleasant I would deliver their mail and be somewhat late to the meeting.,5,The participant mentions being 'somewhat late to the meeting' which indicates they did consider the workplace consequences but were willing to accept a moderate delay. This suggests a medium level of concern about being late and potentially upsetting their boss.,8,The participant explicitly makes their decision based on the mood/trust of the other person ('when while was pleasant I would deliver their mail').

This suggests they would likely choose to help the other person to preserve that good relationship, valuing this aspect significantly in their decision.",0,There is no mention or indication that the participant considered the certainty of the other person's trust in their decision-making process. The response focuses solely on maintaining a good mood and relationship with no reference to how certain the other person was about their feelings.

They specifically mention wanting to 'only miss a bit of the meeting,' indicating that minimizing workplace consequences is a major factor in their decision.",3,"The participant shows limited concern for Y's trust, as they deliberately chose to skip the delivery. While they do consider Y in their thought process, their primary goal appears to be avoiding Y's knowledge of their decision ('Y doesn't know that i skipped the delivery') rather than maintaining Y's trust or mood.",6,"The participant explicitly mentions wanting Y to be unaware of their decision to skip the delivery, suggesting they are considering Y's knowledge state (certainty). They appear to be exploiting Y's uncertainty about whether they attempted the delivery or not, indicating that the certainty factor played a significant role in their decision-making process."
84,1,uncertain,high,it would only go down 1 or 2 levels of trustoworthness which was easy to get back up the next day ,8,The response suggests that the participant prioritized not being late to work. They mention evaluating the potential consequence of the trust going down just 'one or two levels' which implies they were mainly concerned with the work policy. They seem to have calculated that the impact on trust would be minimal and recoverable.,4,"The participant acknowledges the trust factor by mentioning levels of trustworthiness and considering how they would be affected, but they seem to view it as a secondary concern that can be easily fixed later ('easy to get back up the next day'). This suggests moderate, but not high, concern for the other person's trust.",2,"There is very little indication that the participant considered the certainty of the other person's trust. The response focuses on the levels of trustworthiness and their recoverability, but doesn't mention anything about how certain the other person was about their trust judgment. The lack of any reference to certainty suggests it played a minimal role in their decision-making."

86,0,immutable,high,I chose route B mostly since I didn't feel the need to prove anything,7,"The participant chose route B, which means they chose not to deliver the item and instead go straight to work. This suggests they prioritized not being late to work and avoiding upsetting their boss. The response 'I didn't feel the need to prove anything' indicates they didn't feel obligated to go out of their way to deliver the item, suggesting a priority on their work obligations.",3,"The participant's statement 'I didn't feel the need to prove anything' suggests they were somewhat aware of the other person's trust or mood, but didn't feel it was necessary to respond to it. This indicates a relatively low level of concern about the other person's trust, though not completely absent since they recognized there was something that could potentially be 'proven'.",2,"There is minimal evidence in the response that the participant considered the certainty of the other person in their decision. The phrase 'I didn't feel the need to prove anything' could possibly imply some awareness of the other's certainty or uncertainty, but it's very indirect and not explicitly mentioned.

2,0,uncertain,high,this should keep you in good with G  and trust remains high,3,There's no direct mention of concerns about being late to work or upsetting the boss. The participant's primary focus seems to be on the relationship with G rather than work consequences. The low-moderate rating reflects that work concerns might be implicitly present but are not a stated priority in their decision-making process.,9,The participant explicitly mentions wanting to 'keep you in good with G' and that 'trust remains high' which strongly indicates they're basing their decision on maintaining or improving the trust relationship with G. This is clearly the central factor in their reasoning.,1,"There is no explicit reference to G's certainty about their trust. While the participant cares about the trust relationship, they don't mention considering whether G is certain or uncertain about this trust. The response focuses only on maintaining high trust, not on how G's certainty affected their decision."

",3,"The participant shows some concern about their boss (implicit in paths B and D, which relate to being late to work), but it's not the primary factor in their decision-making. They mention selecting paths B and D multiple times, indicating they sometimes prioritized work commitments, but their explanation focuses more on trust considerations.",8,The participant explicitly mentions trust as a key factor in their decision-making. They emphasize that 'choosing path D was not breaking trust' and they frame their entire response around the concept of trust when the other person was in a trusting state of mind. Their decision-making seems heavily influenced by maintaining the trust relationship.,1,There is minimal to no explicit mention of considering the certainty of the other person. The participant only mentions the 'trusting' state of mind but does not reference whether the other person was certain about their trust. The explanation lacks any indication that certainty was a factor in their decision-making process.

It didn't matter how upset they got because I knew they would forget how they were feeling. ,8,"The participant clearly states they wanted to 'get as much time at work as possible,' indicating a high concern for their work responsibilities and not upsetting their boss. They were attempting to balance two competing goals, suggesting work was a significant priority.",2,"The participant mentions they didn't care 'how upset they got' because 'they would forget how they were feeling,' suggesting very little concern for the other person's mood or trust. They acknowledge the delivery task but show minimal concern for the emotional impact on the other person.",0,"There is no indication that the participant considered the certainty of the other person in their decision making.

This suggests they balance work obligations against customer needs rather than prioritizing work unconditionally.",7,"The participant explicitly states they 'wanted to make customer happy,' indicating they placed significant importance on the mood/trust of the other person. This was their primary stated motivation, suggesting high concern for the other's emotional state.",8,"The participant directly considers the certainty of the other's emotional state in their decision-making process, saying 'if he was really happy already' they would prioritize work.

By stating that the job is 'more important,' they are implicitly suggesting that the other person's trust is of lower importance in their decision-making. However, the comparative nature of the statement ('more important') suggests they at least acknowledge some small level of consideration for the other person.",0,There is no mention or indication that the participant considered the certainty of the other person in their decision. Their response focuses solely on the importance of the job with no reference to the other person's certainty about their trust.
71,1,immutable,high,It is easy to maintain his level and raise it,0,There is no mention of concern about being late to work or upsetting their boss in this response. The participant doesn't reference any work-related consequences in their decision-making.,7,"The statement 'It is easy to maintain his level and raise it' suggests the participant is focused on maintaining or improving the other person's trust level. The language indicates they're considering how their actions will affect the relationship with the other person, implying they care about the other's trust/mood.",3,"There's no explicit reference to the certainty of the other person's trust. However, the phrase 'maintain his level' might imply some awareness of the current state of trust, which could indirectly relate to certainty. This is a weak connection though, as the response doesn't clearly address certainty as a factor in their decision."
27,0,certain,high,If Y was already happy there was no need to make him happy.,5,The participant does not explicitly mention concerns about being late to work or upsetting their boss. Their reasoning is based entirely on the other person's existing mood state without reference to work consequences. This suggests a neutral position regarding work concerns.,7,"The participant clearly based their decision on Y's mood ('already happy'), indicating they cared about the other person's emotional state. The reasoning suggests they would act differently if Y wasn't happy, showing that the other person's mood/trust was a significant factor in their decision-making.",2,There is no explicit mention of certainty in their response.

This balanced approach with some day-specific prioritization of the boss indicates a moderate level of concern.",5,"The participant states they tried to 'balance being on time vs pleasing equally no matter what the state of mind was,' indicating they gave equal consideration to pleasing the character as to being on time for work.

They explicitly state that they prioritized pleasing their friends 'until the end of the week' and justify this by noting their boss's 'poor memory.' This suggests they were somewhat strategic about when to prioritize work versus helping friends, based on their perception that their boss wouldn't remember their tardiness. The low-to-moderate rating reflects that while they weren't completely disregarding their work responsibilities, they clearly deprioritized them in favor of helping friends.",8,"The participant shows high concern for their friends' trust/mood by stating they 'tended to focus on pleasing my friends.' This was their primary motivation according to their response, indicating they placed significant value on maintaining positive relationships with friends and ensuring they were pleased, which likely relates to the trust expressed by the facial expressions in the study.

There is no reference to work-related consequences in their statement.,3,"The phrase 'not too concerned about letting them down' indicates some acknowledgment of the other person's trust, but suggests minimal concern about maintaining that trust.

Their response focuses entirely on their ability to disappoint the yellow character, suggesting very little consideration for work responsibilities.",7,"The participant's statement that 'Yellow was least responsive and I could disappoint them frequently' indicates they were considering how their actions would affect the other person. The fact that they specifically noted they 'could disappoint' the character suggests they were aware of and thinking about the character's trust/mood, even if they chose to disappoint them.",8,"The participant directly references the character color (Yellow), suggesting they were paying attention to this feature which represented certainty. Their statement that Yellow was 'least responsive' implies they were comparing levels of certainty across different characters and noted that this particular certainty level allowed them more freedom to disappoint the character, showing they factored certainty significantly into their decision-making."

This demonstrates that making the other person happy was a primary motivation for their decision, outweighing their concern for their boss's reaction.",4,"There is no explicit mention of the other person's certainty in the participant's response.

This suggests a high priority placed on work commitments.",2,"The participant explicitly states they are 'not bothered if they trust me or not', showing very little concern for the other person's trust level. They will deliver the parcel regardless of the trust level, but not because they care about the other's mood.",6,"The participant specifically mentions 'If G is unsure of me', indicating they are considering G's certainty level in their reasoning process. They recognize G's uncertainty but decide it doesn't change their behavior. This shows moderate consideration of certainty in their decision-making."
40,1,certain,medium,"If they're less trusting of me, I'm more likely to just try to get to work on time.",7,The participant clearly prioritizes getting to work on time when the other person is less trusting. This suggests a relatively high concern for their work obligations and not upsetting their boss.,8,The participant explicitly bases their decision on the trust level of the other person ('If they're less trusting of me...'). This indicates they are highly attentive to and influenced by the trust/mood of the other person.,0,The participant makes no mention of the certainty factor (represented by character color) in their decision-making process. They only refer to the trust level without any indication that they considered how certain the other person was about their trust.

This shows high consideration for G's mood/trust, actively trying to reassure G when they appeared concerned.",2,"The participant doesn't explicitly mention considering the certainty of the other person (which would be represented by character color).

43,0,uncertain,medium,Impression is unlikely to change so would focus on work,9,The response clearly prioritizes work obligations over helping the other person.

They explicitly state 'I was pretty sure my actions would not impact Y,' indicating they don't believe their decision would affect the other person's emotional state or level of trust, so there's little consideration given to this aspect.",5,"The participant makes reference to being 'pretty sure' about the impact of their actions on Y, which acknowledges some level of certainty assessment. However, they don't explicitly discuss how the certainty of the other person factored into their decision. The phrase 'within the context of delivering the item on 3 days of the week' might imply some consideration of the scenario parameters, which could include certainty, but it's not clearly articulated as a decision factor."
51,1,uncertain,medium,"May or may not deliver, depending on time of week",7,"The participant's response indicates they are primarily concerned with their work obligations, making the decision conditional on the 'time of week,' suggesting they would prioritize not being late to work on busier work days. This shows a significant consideration for their professional responsibilities and potential consequences from their boss.",3,The participant makes no explicit mention of the other person's mood or trust level in their decision-making process. The statement 'may or may not deliver' shows some willingness to help but doesn't indicate that the other person's trust is a major factor in their decision.,0,There is no indication that the participant considered the certainty level of the other person in their decision.

I tried to keep their mood neutral.,3,"The participant mentions trying to maintain V's 'neutral' mood, but makes no direct reference to concerns about being late to work or upsetting their boss.

This indicates they were significantly concerned with V's mood/trust and how their actions affected it. They seem disappointed that their efforts weren't appreciated, suggesting they valued maintaining V's trust.",2,"There's very little indication that the participant considered the certainty of the other person. The statement focuses on the outcome of their action and V's mood, but doesn't mention anything about how certain V was about trusting them. The phrase 'tried to keep their mood neutral' suggests they were responding to the mood/trust aspect rather than the certainty aspect."
46,1,certain,medium,unsure is okay so I choose instinctively what to prioritise.,4,"The participant mentions choosing 'instinctively what to prioritise,' which implies some consideration of different factors, potentially including work obligations. However, they don't explicitly mention being concerned about lateness or the boss, so a moderate-low rating is appropriate.",6,"When the participant says they 'choose instinctively what to prioritise,' in the context of this study, they are likely referring to weighing the other person's need/trust against other considerations. The response suggests they are making some judgment based on social factors, which would include the other person's trust level.",7,"The participant directly refers to the uncertainty factor with 'unsure is okay,' indicating they are explicitly considering the certainty of the other person in their decision-making process. They seem to be stating that uncertainty doesn't prevent them from making a decision based on their instincts, showing clear awareness of this dimension."
20,1,certain,medium,Nothing to be gained,7,"The response 'Nothing to be gained' suggests a strong pragmatic calculation that focuses on personal costs (like being late to work and potentially upsetting their boss) versus benefits. It indicates they see no advantage in performing the favor, which implies they're prioritizing their work responsibilities significantly.",3,The participant's response shows minimal consideration of the other person's trust or mood. 'Nothing to be gained' suggests they're viewing the interaction primarily through a transactional lens rather than focusing on the other person's feelings or building trust. They may have registered the other's mood but didn't weight it heavily in their decision.,2,There's little evidence that the participant considered the certainty of the other person's trust. The phrase 'Nothing to be gained' focuses on outcome rather than the certainty of the other person's expectations. The response doesn't reference or acknowledge the certainty variable represented by character color.

The reference to V not being 'disappointed a lot' suggests the participant considered V's emotional response to their actions, which relates directly to trust considerations.",2,"There is minimal evidence that the participant considered the certainty of the other person. The mention of V being 'most responsive' could potentially relate to certainty (perhaps implying V's consistent behavior), but this connection is weak and indirect. The response primarily focuses on V's emotional state rather than V's certainty about trusting the participant."

They made a compromise rather than fully prioritizing one over the other, suggesting the boss/work obligation was important but not all-consuming.",5,"The participant states 'so there was no emotion involved' and that they dropped off the item 'as to not be rude,' suggesting a moderate level of concern about social obligation rather than responding to the other person's mood/trust specifically. They were motivated by general politeness rather than the other's emotional state.",2,"The participant explicitly mentions 'even if I wouldn't be judged,' suggesting they were aware the other person might not know about their decision, but this played only a minimal role in their decision-making. The fact that 'V was gone from home' further indicates they weren't highly concerned with the certainty aspect as there was no observer present."

The reference to 'pleasing V' as a priority indicates that the boss's displeasure is a secondary consideration.",8,"The participant explicitly states they would 'focus on pleasing V', indicating they place high importance on the other person's mood/trust. This appears to be their primary consideration in the decision-making process.",5,"The participant mentions 'especially if we were past the halfway point of the week', which suggests some conditional thinking that might relate to certainty, but it's unclear if this is directly addressing the certainty representation (character color).

6,0,immutable,medium,in the middle of pleasing V and pleasing boss,5,"The participant explicitly states they are 'in the middle of pleasing V and pleasing boss,' indicating that concern about the boss and being late to work is one of two equal considerations. This balanced approach suggests a moderate level of concern about upsetting their boss.",5,"The phrase 'in the middle of pleasing V' indicates that the participant is considering V's trust/mood as part of their decision-making process. Since they describe it as being in a balanced state with pleasing their boss, this suggests a moderate level of concern about V's trust.",0,"There is no explicit mention of considering V's certainty about their trust.

59,1,certain,medium,They aren't angry so I would deliver just not speedily,4,"The participant shows some concern about the delivery, noting they 'would deliver' but 'not speedily'. This suggests they are balancing the delivery task with other priorities (likely work/boss concerns) by choosing a middle-ground solution, but they don't explicitly mention concern about lateness or their boss.",6,"The participant directly references the other person's emotional state ('They aren't angry') as the primary justification for their decision to deliver, indicating they are making their choice based on the other person's mood/trust level. This shows clear consideration of the trust dimension.",0,There is no indication the participant considered the certainty of the other person's trust.

This indicates moderate concern for their work responsibilities, though they don't explicitly mention their boss or being late.",3,"The participant showed low-to-moderate concern for the other person's trust by choosing to hide their non-delivery rather than being honest.

Therefore, a relatively low rating is assigned as they seem to have given minimal consideration to work responsibilities.",8,The response directly mentions 'trust' as a primary motivation. The phrase 'Had to please more to gain trust' clearly indicates the participant was highly focused on building or maintaining trust with the other person. This suggests trust was a central consideration in their decision-making process.,5,"There is no explicit mention of the other person's certainty level in the participant's response.

56,1,uncertain,medium,Focus on pleasing Y until they changed mood and then switch to being on time for work.,5,"The participant expresses a conditional prioritization, starting with a focus on pleasing Y (delivering the item) but then switching to prioritizing being on time for work after Y's mood changes. This indicates they care about both aspects but in a sequential manner, suggesting a moderate concern for the boss/work timing.",8,"The participant explicitly states their initial focus was on 'pleasing Y,' indicating high consideration of Y's trust/mood. The fact that the mood change was the trigger for their strategy shift suggests they were closely monitoring and responding to Y's emotional state.",3,"There is no explicit mention of considering Y's certainty in their decision-making process.

They were willing to potentially upset the other person because they believed the negative feelings wouldn't last, showing minimal regard for maintaining the other's trust.",1,"There is almost no evidence that the participant considered the certainty of the other person in their decision-making process. They mention knowing the other person would 'forget how they were feeling,' but don't reference anything about the other person's certainty about their trust.

24,1,uncertain,medium,i would slightly prioritize gaining their trust in order to make them happy.,3,The participant indicates only a slight concern for other priorities (like work) by saying they would 'slightly prioritize' gaining trust. This suggests some awareness of the work/boss consequences but not a strong emphasis on it.,7,"The participant explicitly states they would 'prioritize gaining their trust' as the main goal of their decision. The use of 'slightly' suggests it's not an absolute priority, but it's clearly the dominant consideration in their decision-making process.",0,"There is no mention or reference to the certainty of the other person (represented by character color).

Their response is extremely brief and only focuses on allowing the other person to see them deliver the item, with no reference to work-related concerns.",7,"The participant's response 'Allowed them to see me deliver' suggests they were moderately to highly concerned with the other person's trust. They specifically made sure the other person could see them completing the favor, which indicates they cared about proving their trustworthiness and potentially maintaining or building trust with the other person.",5,"There is some implicit consideration of the other person's certainty in their action of ensuring they were seen delivering the item. This suggests they recognized the other person might have uncertainty about whether the delivery would happen, so they made their action visible. However, since they don't explicitly mention certainty or the character color, a middle rating seems appropriate."

This suggests that being punctual for work is a primary concern that they only consider deprioritizing under specific conditions.",8,"The participant explicitly mentions trust as a crucial factor in their decision-making process, noting that establishing trust with Y allows them to shift priorities. They see delivering the item once as a way to build trust, indicating they value the trust relationship highly.",4,"The participant implicitly acknowledges certainty by mentioning that showing they delivered the item 'once' could establish trust, suggesting some awareness that Y's certainty about trust matters. However, they don't explicitly mention certainty or how Y's confidence in their trustworthiness affects their decision, focusing more on the trust itself rather than Y's certainty about that trust."

They mention the 'state of mind' but don't specifically reference the certainty aspect (character color). Their decision-making seems to be more influenced by the day of the week rather than the certainty of the other person's trust.

This indicates a high concern about their work obligations and not upsetting their boss.",5,"The participant initially 'tried to meet both requests', showing they did consider Y's mood/trust.

However, the brevity of the response and the fact that it equally mentions both the boss and Y suggests a moderate level of concern rather than a high one.",5,"The participant mentions trying to meet Y's expectations, which suggests some concern about Y's trust/mood. Since they mention Y alongside the boss with equal emphasis, this indicates a moderate level of concern for Y's trust rather than a high or low level.",0,"There is no mention in the response about considering Y's certainty or uncertainty about their trust.

Their focus is entirely on influencing the other person's trust, with no mention of work-related concerns.",10,"The participant's response 'I want to change their minds to trust me!' demonstrates that their primary (and only stated) motivation is to alter the other person's trust perception. This suggests they are completely focused on the trust dimension, warranting a maximum score of 10.",0,"There is no evidence in the participant's response that they considered the certainty aspect at all. They only mention wanting to change the other person's trust level, without any reference to how certain the other person was about their trust judgment."

This shows a clear prioritization of work obligations, especially as the week progressed.",8,"The participant explicitly states they 'focused on pleasing Y more in the beginning of the week', showing they gave significant consideration to the other person's trust/mood. They made deliberate efforts to prioritize Y's needs, at least initially.",4,"There is no explicit mention of the participant considering Y's certainty about their trust. However, their shifting strategy throughout the week (from prioritizing Y to prioritizing work) might indicate some awareness of how their actions affected Y's certainty, but this is not clearly articulated."
76,0,immutable,medium,Tried to keep a slight focus on G,6,"The participant indicates they 'tried to keep a slight focus on G', where G likely refers to their goal/policy of not being late to work. This suggests moderate concern about upsetting their boss, but not complete prioritization of work obligations.",4,"The response doesn't explicitly mention the other person's mood or trust, but the phrasing 'slight focus on G' implies that other factors (likely including the other person's trust) were also considered, though perhaps to a lesser extent than the work obligation.",0,There is no indication that the participant considered the certainty of the other person in their decision making process. The response is extremely brief and doesn't mention uncertainty or certainty at all.

They chose routes C and D specifically to mitigate the boss's anger, showing that the boss's reaction was a major consideration in their decision-making.",5,"The participant mentions choosing route A 'to prove I was making a delivery', suggesting moderate concern about fulfilling the delivery task which relates to the other person's trust. However, this appears secondary to their concern about the boss, indicating medium-level consideration of the other person's trust/mood.",0,"There is no explicit mention or indication that the participant considered the certainty of the other person in their decision-making process. The response focuses on balancing between making the delivery and not angering the boss, without any reference to how certain the other person was about trusting them."
2,0,immutable,medium,v needs to be pleased whereas your boss can be appeased at a later date and or you catch up later on with them,3,"The participant acknowledges the boss's concerns but considers them secondary.

The participant does not reference the character color or indicate any awareness of whether the other person was certain or uncertain about their trust.
13,0,certain,medium,"Again, I wanted to choose path A at least a couple times to build trust and certainly avoid C. Probably chose path B a couple times. ",5,"The participant mentions choosing path A 'at least a couple times,' which suggests they were somewhat concerned about being late to work (since path A likely represents not being late), but not extremely so. They don't explicitly mention their boss or work consequences, so they show moderate concern about the policy/work obligations.",8,The participant explicitly states they 'wanted to choose path A at least a couple times to build trust and certainly avoid C.' This indicates they were significantly motivated by building trust with the other person and were actively making decisions based on how their actions would affect the trust relationship.,3,"The participant doesn't directly reference the certainty of the other person's trust (represented by character color). They mention wanting to 'build trust' which implies some awareness of the other's mental state, but there's no explicit indication they were factoring in how certain/uncertain the other person was about trusting them. They chose a mix of paths (A and B) but don't connect this to the certainty dimension."
28,0,uncertain,medium,I wanted to make customer happy but if he was really happy already I  tried to be at work on time ,7,"The response indicates a significant concern about being at work on time, especially if the other person was already in a good mood ('happy already'). This suggests that when not needed to improve the other's mood, the participant prioritized their work obligation.",8,"The participant explicitly states wanting to 'make customer happy', showing high consideration for the other person's mood/trust. They made decisions based on the customer's emotional state, indicating strong importance placed on the other's trust.",9,"The response strongly indicates consideration of certainty with the phrase 'if he was really happy already'.

They explicitly mention wanting to improve the other's view, suggesting they care significantly about the trust dimension. The mention that 'he didn't move up much' suggests they were monitoring the other's trust/mood level and were disappointed it didn't improve more.",2,"There is minimal evidence that the participant considered the certainty of the other person. Their response focuses on the other person's view/trust level without any clear reference to how certain the other person was about this trust. The phrase 'didn't move up much' might slightly relate to measuring the other's certainty, but this connection is tenuous at best."

60,0,uncertain,medium,I wanted to balance both tasks,5,"The participant's response suggests a moderate concern for work obligations. The phrase 'balance both tasks' indicates they were considering their work responsibilities (not being late) as one of the two key factors in their decision-making process, but without expressing a strong priority for it.",5,The response indicates that the participant was also considering the other person's request (implied as the second task to 'balance'). The equal framing of 'balance both tasks' suggests they gave similar weight to addressing the other person's trust/needs as they did to their work obligations.,0,There is no explicit mention or indication that the participant considered the certainty of the other person in their decision-making process. The brief response only mentions balancing tasks but doesn't reference anything about the other person's level of certainty about their trust.

However, this consideration isn't their primary focus, as they don't explicitly mention worrying about upsetting their boss.",7,The phrase 'Try to get them onside' indicates that the participant is prioritizing gaining or maintaining the trust of the other person. This suggests they're quite concerned with how the other person feels about them and trying to ensure positive regard.,2,"There's minimal indication that the participant is considering the certainty of the other person's trust. While trying to 'get them onside' could imply awareness of the other's mental state, the response doesn't specifically address whether they factored in how certain the other person was about trusting them."

Their strategy of pleasing once then deceiving 50% of the time suggests some awareness of the other person's expectations, but there's no explicit mention of considering how certain the other person is about trusting them.

However, they don't explicitly state how this affects their decision to help or not.",2,"The participant's mention of V being 'swayed by gossip' could very indirectly relate to V's certainty level (suggesting V forms opinions based on potentially unreliable information), but they don't clearly address whether V's certainty about trusting them factors into their decision-making process."

Their decision-making process seems primarily driven by the customer's emotional state.",6,"The participant implicitly considers certainty by stating 'if he was really happy already' - suggesting they distinguish between situations where the customer's happiness is certain versus uncertain.

This suggests a moderate level of concern for being on time to work and not upsetting their boss. However, they mention specifically prioritizing the boss on Fridays, which indicates they did care about the boss's reaction at times. The split priority (balanced approach most days, boss-focused on Fridays) suggests a medium level of concern.",6,"The participant mentions trying to 'please the characters' specifically on Mondays, and otherwise attempting to balance pleasing the character with being on time. This indicates a somewhat above-average concern for the other person's mood/trust. The fact that they deliberately prioritized pleasing characters on certain days shows they were attentive to the trust dimension of the task.",2,There is very little indication that the participant considered the certainty of the other person in their decision-making process.

Their entire response revolves around managing G's perception and trust, indicating this was their primary consideration.",8,"The participant clearly considers the certainty aspect when they mention 'if they were in a bad or uncertain if they could trust me.' This shows they were differentiating between scenarios where G was certain or uncertain about trusting them, and adapting their strategy accordingly.

The low-to-moderate rating reflects their acknowledgment of work responsibilities but ultimate dismissal of them.",7,"The participant explicitly states they 'wanted to balance making V happy,' indicating significant consideration of V's trust/mood. They were concerned about V possibly having 'heard bad things' about them, showing they care about V's perception of them.

The phrase 'they had heard bad things about me despite trying my best' indicates the participant is considering the discrepancy between their actions and V's perception, which relates to certainty.

The low-to-moderate rating reflects that work considerations are present but not prioritized.",8,"The participant clearly prioritizes the other person's mood/trust, stating they would 'go route A and please him instantly' as their first action. They also mention maintaining 'a decent level of happiness' which further indicates a high concern for the other person's emotional state and trust.

This suggests they place significant importance on their work responsibilities and potentially avoiding negative reactions from their boss.",6,"The participant mentions they 'tried to deliver stuff', showing they cared enough about the other person to attempt to fulfill the favor. However, they balanced this with their work obligations, suggesting moderate rather than extremely high concern about the other person's trust/mood.",0,"There is no explicit mention or indication that the participant considered the certainty of the other person's trust in their decision-making process.

Their response solely focused on making character G happy, with no indication they considered workplace consequences.",10,"The participant explicitly stated they were 'Focused on making G happy,' indicating their decision was entirely based on the other person's mood/trust.

This suggests a high concern about potential workplace consequences.",3,"The participant acknowledges the other person's mood ('Not much chance of improving their mood') which shows some awareness of the other's trust/mood, but they ultimately dismiss it as not worth pursuing, suggesting relatively low importance placed on the other's trust compared to workplace obligations.",2,"The participant doesn't explicitly mention the certainty of the other person in their response. The statement 'Not much chance of improving their mood' could implicitly reference certainty (suggesting they assessed the probability of changing the mood), but this is ambiguous and doesn't clearly indicate they were considering how certain the other person was about their trust."

Their decision is completely driven by the desire to demonstrate trustworthiness and improve the other person's negative emotional state.",8,"The participant clearly considers the certainty of the other person by specifically choosing 'the route he knows I'll deliver it.' This indicates they're taking into account what the other person is certain about, ensuring their action matches the other's expectations.

The statement 'I took this as a sign to focus more on work' directly shows that work was their primary concern in this scenario.",3,"While the participant acknowledges G's mood, they seem to have low consideration for it in their decision-making process. They recognize G's mood, but their statement 'no matter what I did G would stay in this mood' indicates they believe their actions wouldn't affect the other person's trust/mood, leading them to deprioritize this factor.",5,"The participant references G's mood staying the same 'no matter what I did,' which could indicate awareness of the certainty aspect.

However, they explicitly state they 'wasn't bothered about making them happy', showing limited concern for improving the other's positive mood. This asymmetric concern suggests a moderate level of consideration for the other's mood/trust.",0,There is no indication that the participant considered the certainty of the other person in their decision-making process.

Their response lacks any mention of workplace consequences or their professional obligations, suggesting they prioritized other factors in their decision-making process.",6,"The statement 'if they felt this way' indicates the participant was considering the other person's feelings/trust state. The phrase suggests they recognized the other person's mood or trust level as a significant factor, even if they viewed it as fixed or unchangeable.",8,"The participant explicitly references the unchangeable nature of the other person's mindset with 'there was no changing it,' strongly suggesting they perceived the other person's certainty as high and fixed.

This suggests a high concern for their work responsibilities and not wanting to be late.,7,"The participant specifically references the other person being 'cross with me' as a reason not to help, indicating they are quite responsive to the mood/trust level of the other person. They seem to feel that the negative attitude doesn't warrant them doing a favor that would inconvenience themselves.",6,"The participant mentions that the other person 'listen[s] to gossip', which appears to reference the certainty aspect (the person forms opinions based on potentially unreliable information). The participant factors this into their decision, suggesting they are considering whether the other person's negative assessment is well-founded or not."

The statement focuses more on the distrust itself rather than how certain the other person was about their distrust. The phrase 'who doesn't trust me yet still asks me' suggests some awareness of the other person's mental state, but doesn't clearly address certainty levels."
89,0,immutable,low,"I showed kindness to Y because he was annoyed, knowing that my boss would forget that I missed the meeting.",3,"The participant mentions that 'my boss would forget that I missed the meeting,' indicating they did consider their work obligations, but they believed there would be minimal consequences for being late.

They made their decision primarily based on Y's mood/trust, showing significant concern for improving Y's emotional state.",2,"There is minimal evidence that the participant considered the certainty of the other person's trust. They mention Y was 'annoyed,' focusing on the mood/emotional state, but do not reference or indicate consideration of how certain Y was about this emotional state.

The participant seems to have given this factor roughly equal weight to other considerations in their decision-making process, suggesting a moderate level of concern.",3,"There is no explicit mention of considering the certainty of the other person. The reference to 'impossible some of the time' could potentially indicate some awareness of varying conditions, but there's no clear evidence they were specifically considering the certainty factor in their decision making.

The phrase 'opted to be on time' shows their final decision favored work obligations.",5,"The participant did consider pleasing G (the other person), as indicated by 'Contemplated pleasing G', showing some level of concern for the other person's trust/mood. However, this concern was not strong enough to override their work responsibilities.",2,"There is very little evidence that the participant considered the certainty of the other person. The phrase 'as only one day' might slightly suggest they were considering the limited nature of the interaction or perhaps the certainty level, but this is quite ambiguous and doesn't clearly indicate consideration of the other's certainty about trust."
63,0,immutable,low,"Since he was not sure he could trust me, I made sure he knew I had made the delivery",2,The participant shows very little consideration for being late to work or upsetting their boss.

They specifically mention that the other person 'was not sure he could trust me,' and their action was directly motivated by building trust by making sure the person knew they had completed the delivery.",8,The participant clearly acknowledges the other person's uncertainty about trust ('not sure he could trust me') and specifically tailors their response to address this uncertainty by ensuring confirmation of the delivery. This shows they considered the certainty element in their decision-making process and adjusted their behavior accordingly.
37,1,immutable,low,Y's mood wouldn't change regardless of my actions.,0,"The participant doesn't mention any consideration about being late to work or upsetting their boss. Their response is solely focused on Y's unchanging mood, with no reference to work-related concerns.",3,"The participant acknowledges Y's mood, indicating some awareness of the other person's emotional state.

The response only mentions Y's mood staying the same regardless of actions, but doesn't address the certainty component represented by character color."
46,1,uncertain,low,"G is less sensitive, they should just learn to accomodate. i have a JOB.",10,"The participant's response strongly emphasizes their job obligation with the capitalized 'JOB.'

There's no explicit mention of the boss, but the choice of path A (presumably the quicker route that doesn't involve delivering the item) strongly suggests they place high importance on work obligations.",8,"The participant explicitly states that 'V already doesn't trust me' as their primary reasoning, indicating they are highly aware of and concerned with the other person's trust level. Their decision appears to be directly based on this perception of existing distrust.",0,There is no mention of certainty in the participant's response. They refer only to the trust level ('V already doesn't trust me') without any indication that they considered how certain V was about this trust level. The certainty dimension does not appear to factor into their decision-making process at all.

They specifically note that they 'could disappoint them frequently,' showing they were considering the impact of their actions on the other person's trust or mood.",7,"The participant explicitly mentions the color (yellow) and associates it with being 'least responsive,' suggesting they were considering the certainty aspect represented by the character color. They seem to understand that the yellow color signified something about the certainty of the other person's reactions, leading them to believe they could disappoint this character frequently without major consequences."

The focus seems to be entirely on changing the other person's state rather than work considerations.",8,"The participant's main focus is on the other person's mood/trust as indicated by 'until he has become positive.'

They're weighing whether the action is 'worth it,' indicating they recognize there's a potential cost to helping, but they don't explicitly mention their boss or work consequences.",5,"The participant references that 'sometimes it had a good lasting impact,' which suggests some consideration of how their action affects the other person. However, they don't explicitly mention the other person's mood or trust level, and the vague '50/50' approach suggests moderate rather than strong consideration of the other person's feelings.",2,"There is little evidence that the participant is considering the certainty of the other person in their decision-making process. They mention evaluating whether the action 'was worth it' and had a 'good lasting impact,' but don't reference the other person's certainty about trust at all.

The statement 'I didn't think one day would change Y all that much' might very indirectly suggest some consideration of how their action would affect Y's certainty about them, but this is quite minimal and not explicitly stated."
87,1,certain,low,Not sure how I responded to this but the latter half I was trying to balance over all.,5,"The participant mentions trying to 'balance over all' in the latter half, suggesting they were giving some consideration to multiple factors, including possibly their job obligations. However, there is no explicit mention of concern about being late to work or upsetting their boss, so a moderate rating is assigned due to the ambiguity.",5,"The participant's comment about 'trying to balance over all' suggests they were considering multiple factors, which could include the other person's trust/mood. However, they don't explicitly mention the other person's mood or trust level, so it's unclear how much weight they gave to this factor.",2,"There is no direct indication that the participant considered the certainty of the other person in their decision-making process.

The low score of 2 reflects the apparent lack of consideration for the boss/work policy.",7,"The participant clearly paid attention to V's mood (looking 'unhappy') and initially tried to please V by delivering items.

They mention V 'almost looked unhappy every day' but don't reference the character color or any awareness of V's certainty about their trust.

The fact that they chose not to deliver the parcel to avoid this trouble suggests it was a significant factor in their decision-making.",6,"The participant mentions that delivering the parcel 'wouldn't have improved the happiness,' suggesting they did consider the other person's mood/trust, and that their assessment of the lack of positive impact on the person's mood influenced their decision. They also mention 'no gratitude,' indicating they considered how the other person would react to their action.",4,"There is a weak indication that the participant considered certainty in their mention of 'lots of suspicion,' which could be referring to the character's certainty level. However, they don't explicitly mention certainty or confidence, so it appears to have been a less important factor in their decision compared to the potential trouble at work and the perceived lack of impact on the other's happiness."
18,0,certain,low,"I knew V is more reactive so I would focus on pleasing V, then allow myself to work later.",4,"The participant mentions allowing themselves to 'work later', which indicates some consideration for their work responsibilities, but this appears to be secondary to pleasing V.

They describe V as 'more reactive', suggesting they're very concerned about V's mood and maintaining V's trust, prioritizing this above work obligations.",2,There is no explicit mention of considering V's certainty in their decision-making process. The focus is on V being 'reactive' (which relates to mood/trust) rather than any consideration of how certain V is about their beliefs.

This could refer to their boss, implying they felt pressure to perform within limited time, indicating they cared about work obligations and potentially feared consequences of failing to meet expectations.",8,"The phrase 'to please him' strongly suggests that the participant was primarily motivated by the other person's feelings or trust. The focused desire to please indicates high concern for the other person's mood or maintaining their trust, rather than just fulfilling a task.",3,"There is little explicit indication that the participant considered the certainty of the other person in their decision. The time constraint ('only had one day') was emphasized, but there's no clear reference to how certain the other person was about their trust.
